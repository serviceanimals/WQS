Water Quality Specialist https://serviceanimals.github.io/WQS/

I discovered the Flint Water Crisis back in 2013.  Specifically, my service dog Lady was the one who discovered it years before it was initially announced as a water crisis.  My ability to understand this service animal enabled me to understand its message when it would not drink any of the tap water I offered, filtered and unfiltered.

By the time service dog Lady moved to Flint, Michigan this service dog's ability to detect good water was formidable for it had crossed the Rocky Mountains three times and vacationed in the Carpathian Alps in Europe with me by then.
