Water Quality Specialist https://serviceanimals.github.io/WQS/

I discovered the Flint Water Crisis in back in 2013.  Specifically, service dog Lady was the one who discovered it years before it was initially announced.  My ability to understand this service animal enabled me to understand her message when she would not drink any of the tap water offered to her, filtered and unfiltered.

By the time service dog Lady moved to Flint her ability to detect good water was formidable for she had crossed the Rocky Mountains three times by then and vacationed in the Carpathian Alps in Europe.
