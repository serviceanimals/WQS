Water Quality Specialist https://serviceanimals.github.io/WQS/

I discovered the Flint Water Crisis back in late autumn 2013.  Specifically, my service dog Lady was the one who discovered it years before it was initially announced as a water crisis.  My ability to understand this service animal enabled me to understand its message when it would not drink any of the tap water I offered, filtered and unfiltered.

By the time service dog Lady moved to Flint, Michigan this service dog's ability to detect good water was formidable for it had crossed the Rocky Mountains three times and vacationed in the Carpathian Alps in Europe with me.

On the west coast, when we would go shopping at BevMo! for bottled water, she would point with her nose and use body and facial mimicry to help me choose the bottled water that she wanted me to get for us to consume.  Surprisingly, imported water scored lower than domestic.
