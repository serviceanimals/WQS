Water Quality Specialist https://serviceanimals.github.io/WQS/

I discovered the Flint Water Crisis back in late autumn 2013.  Specifically, my service dog Lady was the one who discovered it years before it was initially announced as a water crisis.  My ability to understand this service animal enabled me to understand its message when it would not drink any of the tap water I offered, filtered and unfiltered.

By the time service dog Lady moved to Flint, Michigan this service dog's ability to detect good water was formidable for it had crossed the Rocky Mountains three times and vacationed in the Carpathian Alps in Europe with me.

On the west coast, when we would go shopping at BevMo! for bottled water, she would point with her nose and use body and facial mimicry to help me choose the bottled water that she wanted me to get for us to consume.  Surprisingly, imported water scored lower than domestic.

<!--Nasal IQ
For the purpose of this mathematical example let's assume 100 IQ points divided by five senses.
This gives 20 IQ points for the sense of smell alone.
In order to find out how many IQ points a canine has quantity and volume should be used.
They can have more than 220 million sensory receptor sites in the nasal cavity compared to 5 million in people, and the area of the canine brain devoted to analyzing odors is about 40 times larger than the comparable part of the human brain.
Canines is also have a fully developed vomeronasal organ.-->
